<!-- BACKGROUND -->

Programming is a journey in lifelong learning. **Quiznet** is an application that aims to help make this as easy as possible. It can either be used with the premade questions, or JSON files of your own.

<!-- Hopefully there is a question or two in there that you didn't already know. If there's something that you'd recommend being added, please go to the [contribution](#contributing) section. -->

<!-- FEATURES -->

## Features

- [x] Questions for JavaScript and React.js
- [ ] Topic Selector

See the [open issues](https://github.com/sf-adams/quiznet/issues) for a full list of proposed features (and known issues).

## Getting Started

The first step is to fork a copy of the Quiznet repository to your own account. Follow the [official instructions](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/quickstart/fork-a-repo) from GitHub.

After completing that step, in the command line:

1. Clone your new repo by typing `git clone https://github.com/YOUR-USERNAME/quiznet.git`
2. Then type `cd quiznet` to go into the project's directory
3. Install the dependencies with `npm install`

## Deployment

Once you finish your setup, you can put your own version of Quiznet online to share with friends and colleagues!
